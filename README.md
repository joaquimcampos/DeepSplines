# Deep Spline Neural Networks

This repository contains the necessary code for using Deep Spline activation
functions in a neural network, as well as reproducing the results reported in
the following papers:

-   [Learning Activation Functions in Deep (Spline) Neural Networks](http://bigwww.epfl.ch/publications/bohra2003.html) [[1]](#1)
-   [Deep Neural Networks with Trainable Activations and Controlled Lipschitz Constant](http://bigwww.epfl.ch/publications/aziznejad2001.html) [[2]](#2)

This framework is based on the theoretical work of
[M. Unser](http://bigwww.epfl.ch/publications/unser1901.html) [[3]](#3).
